editor narrow search list fields functions contain you’ve typed. you type appears explore page. when select field list, it's added expression. this ensures fields unique names adding operators you add logical operators like and, or, and not to expression needed. ordinarily and operators evaluated before or operators, override behavior using parentheses. use comparison (such as >, =, and <=) mathematical as + and *). when cursor operator, check notes displayed right expression the information pane for proper use. the thing mind how true false handled. you use yes instead false. these logical constants words \"yes\" \"no\", enclosed quotes. adding functions to include function expression, start typing function’s name. as type editor narrow search list fields functions contain you’ve typed. functions constructed arguments (or variables) require certain type, field, number, yes\/no. when cursor function, check notes displayed right expression the information pane to understand need provide, type. to see list functions offered, functions operators page. you read detailed instructions using functions section page called using functions. using error hints information pane note type expression, displays information pane right. this provides documentation suggestions, especially error expression. as shown above, editor provides: error highlighting: in editor itself, underlines red any parts expression correct. suggestions error details: the information pane gives suggestions add expression. if there’s error, explains error occurring. multiple errors, shows based location cursor. documentation: in lower information pane, displays documentation function operator you’re working with, based cursor position. for example, type first argument an if() function, provides evaluate true false. you click section navigate function. including comments you include comments expressions beginning comment line with #: using fields sometimes you’ll want use value field (a dimension, measure, table calculation) expression. you add else, check certain value, include function, possibilities. as described above, just type field expression editor, help correct way reference it. when add expression, uses field’s identifier, looks like ${view_name.field_name}. this identifier does match field picker, it’s okay don’t know is. just appears picker editor together. there ways want retrieve value: get value same row: the basic way use field reference directly. for example, expression use ${product.category}. when this, you’re saying “for any given row, grab product category row.” get value different row: you field’s value different row. for example, want logic “for any given row, grab product category the previous row.” to that, use offset function (see list positional functions here). it look like this: offset(${product.category}, -1). get value pivoted column: you values pivoted columns. for example, want logic “for any given row, grab total sales first column.” to work with columns, you’ll need use pivot functions (see list functions here). it look like this: pivot_index${alert_event.event_count}, 1). get total row column: if you added totals explore, total values column row adding :total (for totals) or :row_total (for field name, using format ${field_name:total}. for example, want percentage an alerts count, create table calculation like this: ${alert_event.event_count} \/ ${alert_event.event_count:total}. using functions expressions include functions, help retrieve certain data calculate things. they similar nature excel functions. if familiar with functions, form followed parentheses, like this: my_function(). sometimes you’ll need provide information separated commas. these bits called “arguments” look this: my_function(argument_1, argument_2). for example, the now function does any arguments, gives current date time. you’d use like this: now(). in contrast, the round function does take argument, number. you’d use like this: round(3.2). the result is 3. there ways know arguments you’ll need provide, any: the information pane that appears right expression editor provide documentation function writing. you navigate directly functions operators page look function want use. to solidify concept, consider the contains function documentation looks like this: function syntax purpose contains contains (string, search_string) returns yes if string contains search_string, and no otherwise you see arguments required. they names string and search_string, doesn’t mean need type exact word “string” “search_string” function. these just names you’ll replace with something. reading purpose, that string should field value want search in, the search_string is thing search for. an example be: if word “great” appears customer feedback function result of yes, of no. the final thing know functions inside handle complex logic want. as long result inner function appropriate arguments outer function, work. for example: here we’ve nested the is_null function inside an if function, itself a contains function. it works like this: the is_null() function checks customer feedback text. next, the if() function uses result returns customer feedback text it, comment text. finally, the contains() function uses text returned the if() function searches word “great”. putting together, logically expression means “if customer feedback search that, don’t, comments instead. in cases, look word ‘great’ “.
