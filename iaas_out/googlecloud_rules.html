A service account is a special Google account that belongs to application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end user. Application/VM-Instance uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved. In addition to being an identity, a service account is a resource which has IAM policies attached to it. These policies determine who can use the service account. In order to implement least privileges best practices, IAM users should not be assigned Service Account User role at project level. Instead iam.serviceAccountUser role should be assigned to a user for a specific service account giving a user access to the service account.</td>
